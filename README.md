### Executive Summary
#### 1.1 Introduction 
The team was engaged by Mobilify, through the Heinz College System Synthesis course, to conduct a community-based assessment of Pittsburgh Regional Transit’s (PRT) Silver Line (SL). The goal of this report is to serve as a reference document for any future engagement with PRT regarding transit service in the area currently served by the Silver Line. 

**Chapter 2** provides an overview of the current status of the Silver Line, including financial performance, ridership trends, and operational context within the broader PRT system. 

**Chapter 3** analyzes the potential implications of either continuing or discontinuing service on the Silver Line. It examines the anticipated impacts on PRT’s network, affected communities, and regional mobility. 

**Chapter 4** presents a transit needs assessment informed by zoning and land use regulations, local demographics, and an evaluation of existing social and transit-supportive infrastructure. 

**Chapter 5** outlines two alternative service concepts, evaluating each in terms of feasibility, benefits, challenges, and key considerations for implementation. 

**Together, these chapters provide a comprehensive framework to guide decision-making around the future of the Silver Line corridor.**

#### 1.2 Recommended Alternatives

To address the Silver Line’s persistently low ridership and high operating costs—particularly along the Washington Junction to Library segment—this report evaluates two long-term alternatives. The first is a direct rail-to-trail conversion, which repurposes the underutilized corridor into a multi-use recreational trail. This option offers significant cost savings, reduces ongoing subsidies, and supports public health and community connectivity. Drawing on a comparable case study from Virginia’s Eastern Shore Rail Trail, the report estimates that a Silver Line trail conversion would cost approximately $11–$14 million, a one-time investment far below current annual subsidy levels.

The second alternative explores a demonstration light rail project using battery-electric rolling stock and a shuttle-style service model. This approach would preserve transit operations at reduced cost and footprint, leveraging public-private partnership (PPP) opportunities such as Rail Development Corporation’s Pop-Up Metro platform. However, the demonstration model would still require significant capital investment, faces uncertain ridership recovery, and introduces new operational and governance complexities.
Overall, the alternatives present a clear trade-off: the rail-to-trail option offers a lower-cost, lower-risk path aligned with current demand, while the demonstration model maintains transit presence but with greater financial and institutional uncertainty.

#### 1.3 Impact Analysis and Community Needs Analysis

The impact and community needs analyses demonstrate that the Silver Line’s current service model south of Washington Junction is financially unsustainable and misaligned with local land use and transit demand. Maintaining service in this segment requires over $23 million in annual subsidies while serving a limited number of riders—fewer than 400 daily commuters in the Library section. Discontinuing service would impose modest increases in travel costs, particularly for carless households, but would free up substantial resources for reinvestment in more effective transit solutions.

Meanwhile, the community needs assessment reveals that restrictive zoning in Bethel Park and South Park severely limits the development of the higher-density, multifamily housing necessary to support high-capacity transit. With minimum lot sizes, excessive parking mandates, and a limited supply of transit-accessible multifamily land, current policies cap potential ridership and constrain the corridor’s productivity. Additionally, gaps in pedestrian, bicycle, and transit infrastructure—such as sparse sidewalks, poor bike comfort ratings, and limited bus connectivity—further reduce access and reliance on public transit.

Together, these findings suggest that without substantial zoning reform and infrastructure investment, maintaining traditional rail service is not feasible. Any future use of the corridor must be grounded in a realistic understanding of regional travel patterns, land use constraints, and the need for coordinated, community-driven planning.
